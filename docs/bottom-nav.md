# BottomNav System Architecture

## Overview

The **BottomNav** is not just a navigation widget; it is a **system-level interaction controller** that facilitates 2D navigation:
- **Horizontal Axis (X):** Navigation between top-level functional areas (Pages).
- **Vertical Axis (Y):** Access to contextual actions relevant to the current page (Contextual Rows).

This system is designed to keep the main navigation clean while offering powerful, context-aware tools without cluttering the screen or requiring modal overlays.

## Interaction Model

The BottomNav interaction is strictly defined by physical axes:

1.  **Horizontal Scrolling (Main Nav):**
    *   **Action:** Swipe Left/Right on the navigation pill.
    *   **Result:** Scrolls the main button row to access top-level destinations (e.g., Dashboard, Messages, Portfolio).
    *   **Behavior:** Standard scroll physics with snap points.

2.  **Vertical Paging (Contextual Actions):**
    *   **Action:** Swipe Up (from Main Nav) or Swipe Down (from Context Row).
    *   **Result:** Switches the *entire* viewable row between the "Main Nav" and the "Contextual Row".
    *   **Behavior:** 
        *   **Axis Locking:** The gesture locks to the Y-axis once vertical movement dominates.
        *   **Capture:** Uses `Pointer Events` with `setPointerCapture` to track gestures even if the finger leaves the hit area.
        *   **Commit:** A row switch only commits if the swipe exceeds a 25% threshold or high velocity. Otherwise, it snaps back.

## Registry Pattern

To maintain separation of concerns, the `BottomNav` component **does not know about specific pages or routes**. It acts as a dumb container that displays whatever functionality is registered by the current active page.

This is achieved via the `BottomNavContext` and the `useRegisterBottomNavRow` hook.

### How it Works

1.  **Registry:** The `BottomNavContext` maintains a registry of rows keyed by an ID.
2.  **Registration:** When a page loads (e.g., `Chat.tsx`), it calls `useRegisterBottomNavRow` to register its specific actions (e.g., `QuickActionsRow`).
3.  **Display:** The `BottomNav` listens to the context. If a contextual row exists for the active view, it enables vertical swiping and renders the registered row in the "down" slot.

### Example Usage

Inside a page component:

```tsx
// Chat.tsx
import { useRegisterBottomNavRow } from "@/contexts/BottomNavContext";
import { QuickActionsRow } from "@/features/chat/components/QuickActionsRow";

export default function Chat() {
  // Register the contextual row. 
  // IMPORTANT: Memoize the content to prevent infinite registration loops.
  const quickActions = useMemo(() => (
    <QuickActionsRow onAction={handleAction} />
  ), [handleAction]);

  useRegisterBottomNavRow("chat-actions", quickActions);

  return <div>Chat Content...</div>;
}
```

## Architectural Rules (Non-Negotiable)

To preserve the maintainability and scalability of this system, the following rules must be strictly observed:

1.  **No Route Logic in BottomNav:** 
    *   ❌ **FORBIDDEN:** `if (location.pathname === '/chat') return <ChatActions />` inside `BottomNav.tsx`.
    *   ✅ **REQUIRED:** `BottomNav` simply renders `{contextualRow}` provided by the context. Logic belongs in the *Page*.

2.  **Presentational Shell Only:**
    *   The `BottomNav` component is responsible **only** for layout, gesture handling, and animation. It must never contain business logic, data fetching, or hardcoded action buttons.

3.  **Single Source of Truth:**
    *   The `BottomNavContext` is the sole authority on what is currently displayed in the contextual slot.

## Terminology

-   **Main Nav:** The default, persistent row containing top-level navigation links.
-   **Contextual Row:** An ephemeral row of actions specific to the user's current task (e.g., "Send Proposal" in Chat).
-   **Registry:** The internal state map in `BottomNavContext` that stores active contextual rows.
-   **Gesture Capture Layer:** A transparent overlay in `BottomNav` that intercepts pointer events to ensure reliable swiping without interfering with browser gestures (pull-to-refresh).
